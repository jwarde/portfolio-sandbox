This is a jquery-mobile app which is designed to give quick projected earnings of a financial services projects.

I have used CDNs and placed all the associated css styles and javascript code within the .htm file. This is to minimise 
the files you need to download.

For further information on how to use the jquery platform please go to jquerymobile.com, for themes go to the themeroller 
at page http://themeroller.jquerymobile.com. To add further styles information you can edit the associated css theme created; 
if the new style code does not render you should and add the '!important;' text at the end of each css line.

The javascript used is explained at https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp; the following links maybe useful to understand javascript:
Variables: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp
Functions: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp
DOM: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_elements.asp
Links: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_whereto.asp

Hope you find this useful for your own project.
Have a good day,
John Warde
